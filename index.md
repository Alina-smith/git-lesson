# Notes from Git, Github and Gitkraken course
Here are the notes I've taken from the [course](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/).

I've learned how to:
1. Create a repository.
2. How to _stage_, _commit_ and _push_ from my **local** repository to the **origin**.
3. How to _pull_ from **origin** to **local**.

Next I'm going to publish a webpage.
